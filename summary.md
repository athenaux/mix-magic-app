# Mix Magic App - Project Summary

## Overview
Mix Magic App is a sophisticated digital color mixing application that simulates realistic pigment mixing behavior, designed for artists, designers, and color enthusiasts. Built with modern web technologies, it provides an intuitive interface for experimenting with traditional artist pigments and understanding color theory.

## Core Capabilities

### üé® Digital Pigment Mixing
- **Realistic Color Mixing**: Uses subtractive color mixing algorithms (CMYK conversion) to simulate how real pigments behave when mixed together
- **Multiple Pigment Support**: Mix up to 5 different pigments simultaneously for complex color combinations
- **Artist-Grade Pigments**: Comprehensive collection of traditional artist pigments including:
  - Reds (Cadmium Red, Alizarin Crimson, Vermillion, Rose Madder, Burnt Sienna)
  - Oranges (Cadmium Orange, Raw Sienna, Burnt Umber, Yellow Ochre)
  - Yellows (Cadmium Yellow, Lemon Yellow, Naples Yellow, Chrome Yellow)
  - Greens (Viridian, Sap Green, Chrome Green, Hookers Green, Terre Verte, Olive Green)
  - Blues (Ultramarine Blue, Prussian Blue, Cerulean Blue, Cobalt Blue, Phthalo Blue, Azure Blue)
  - Purples (Dioxazine Purple, Quinacridone Violet, Ultramarine Violet, Permanent Violet)
  - Earth Tones and additional specialized pigments

### üñºÔ∏è Interactive User Interface
